    **Bolon de Verde**

    Preheat your air fryer to 400F. I use the [Dash Compact Air
    Fryer](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B075BCVSJZ/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=B075BCVSJZ&linkCode=as2&tag=andeanvegan-20&linkId=cb91827d72ec10764ee49e387fd2432c).

    1. Peel and slice the plaintains. You can also slice, and then peel
    individually, whatever works best for you.

    2. In a skillet over medium high heat, add the oil and cook until
    the plantains turn a nice yellow color and slightly browned, 5-7 minutes

    3. Add 1/2 cup of water to the skillet, and cover to steam the
    plantains. Using this approach means we can use less oil. Add
    more water as needed, continue cooking until plantains are soft
    and mashable, about 10 minutes.
    4. Put the plantain slices in a bowl, and mash with a potato masher
    until a dough is formed. Add a little bit of water if mixture is
    too dry.
    5. Add cumin, pepper, and salt to taste. The dough should taste
    salty.
    6. Take a handful of dough, and mold into a ball, about the size of
    a baseball. Press two fingers into the ball to make an indentation,
    and fill with cheese, about 2 tbsp, and then reform the ball so
    cheese is locked inside.

    7. Fry in your air fryer, 10-15 minutes, until the bolon are slightly
    brown and heated through.

Bolon de verde are green plantain dumplings, most often stuffed with
cheese and/or chicharrones (pork). This version uses vegan cheese,
and makes a great, satisfying breakfast. It would also probably be good
with some sliced vegan sausage.

The vegan cheese that I like the most for these are Field Roast Chao
slices, but I think any vegan cheese that melts and you like would work
well here. I used the plain flavor of Chao. Each dumpling takes half a
slice. I usually turn the slices into shreds by cutting them up with my
knife.
